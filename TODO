Bugs
====

- Constructs:
  - Recipes should be adjusted to match original, UB ones changed if needed
  - Not all items should be craftable: no smoothstone stairs, no brick buttons
  - In creative picking blocks picks wrong one
  - Metamorphic stone walls have incorrect localization
  - It is impossible to put torches on top of walls
  - Sometimes wall item on the ground from a broken wall graphically shows as a different one (?)
  - Internal: no need to traverse through blocks to find UB blocks, change UB code if needed
